<div> Hi, I’m Dakota! I am a 32 year old FTM web developer and artist! 
I’m interested in Web Development, IT, and Video game Development and/or anything else along those lines. Computers and behind the scenes anything-I am there! If there is something you think i would enjoy please shoot it my way, i am always up for learning new things especially if it has to do with tech! </div> <br>
<div>I am fresh out of a coding boot camp so I am looking to strengthen my skills in the tech world to get the ball rolling on my new career. I have looked into a few things and trying to soak in as much as i can when i can but obviously starting with the basics.
I’m currently learning Python coding language, book keeping for small businesses, React, and a few other things that may put me in a better position to have a good understanding of web development. </div> <br>
